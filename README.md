# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
A deep learning-based project for detecting brain tumors from MRI images.
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
Trained on a labeled dataset of brain MRI scans.
Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.
Aims to assist in early and accurate tumor diagnosis.
